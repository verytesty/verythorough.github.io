* Uses d3.js force layout to display connected concepts
* Connects with Firebase DB for realtime concept additions (in progress)
* Created with teammates: Angel Tam, Patience Haggin, Anna C., Shobana Ramesh, and Karla Lopez
* My contributions: coding and formatting the inline svg images and d3 force layout; transferring app hosting to github project page
* Future plans: fix firebase connection, add multi-user simultaneous concept-adding, add generated link addresses for saving and sharing
