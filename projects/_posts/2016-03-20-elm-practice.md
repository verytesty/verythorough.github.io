* A simple repo and site for storing little projects while I familiarize myself with the syntax and coding patterns of [elm](http://elm-lang.org/)
* My first project, String Mod, experiments with converting a user-supplied string to match various conventions of capitalization and character replacement, from AP Title Case to l337.
