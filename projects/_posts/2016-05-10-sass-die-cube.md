description: Six empty divs turned into an animated 3D die using only CSS (Sass)

* An interview problem shared by a friend: turn six empty `<div>` elements into a 3D die (with dots for the numbers) using only CSS.
* Used Sass to abstract some of the code and allow easy configuration by viewers.  For example, changing the `$front-face` variable on line 4 changes which side of the die faces front.
* Obviously not semantic, nor accessible, but it is responsive and touch-friendly, including altered instructions based on touch-enabled status.
