description: Custom-built WordPress site
---

WordPress custom theme built from scratch:

* My original design from concept to completion
* Fully responsive with semantic, CSS-only drop-in menu on mobile
* Custom post types and taxonomies for courses, instructors, programs, and events
* Custom shortcode uses PHP & javascript to allow content editors to easily add an anchor link menu to any page or post. 
* Server-side API integration for updates from facebook, Instagram, and college course schedule
* PHP script generates current course display based on current month.
* Hand-optimized, responsive inline svg for images that change color with the page without the use of sprites.  (One-line js feature detection allows graceful degradation to png where needed.)
* Sass mixins for media queries, looping through colors
* Vanilla javascript to reveal hidden (but accessible) page elements
* Clean, semantic, accessible HTML5
