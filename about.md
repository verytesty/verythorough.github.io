title: About

A lifelong learner, trained as a teacher, I'm a pattern seeker and a tinkerer with a passion for making things beautiful, functional, or delicious (and sometimes all three).

Outside of work, I've baked and decorated wedding cakes, designed and sewn prize-winning garments, and taken apart and repaired all sorts of home appliances.  I've even had someone dress up as me for Halloween!  I live in the beautiful San Francisco Bay Area and enjoy exploring its natural wonders with my shiba inus, [Petunia](http://miss-petunia.com) and [Monty](http://mr-monty.com).
